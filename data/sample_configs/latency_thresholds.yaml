# Example latency thresholds for detecting relative latency anomalies
# These values are purely illustrative and should be adapted per system.

# Thresholds expressed in milliseconds (absolute) or ratio (relative)

absolute_thresholds:
  # Any event exceeding these absolute latencies may be flagged
  processing_ms_warn: 800
  processing_ms_alert: 1500
  tool_call_ms_warn: 1200
  tool_call_ms_alert: 2500

relative_thresholds:
  # Relative latency gap = |a - b| / max(a, b)
  # Values above these may indicate an early instability signal
  sibling_span_gap_warn: 0.25   # 25%
  sibling_span_gap_alert: 0.40  # 40%

window_rules:
  # Sliding window rules for short-term spikes
  # e.g., if 3 spikes within 20 events → suspicious
  short_window_size: 20
  max_spikes_in_window: 3

pattern_rules:
  # Optional shape-based rules for latency curve irregularities
  jitter_spike_ratio_warn: 1.5
