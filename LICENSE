## ✔ Summary

| Category                                   | License    |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| Code (`.py`, generator scripts, utilities) | Apache-2.0 |
| Documentation, markdown, notebooks         | CC BY 4.0  |

This structure keeps the **code maximally permissive** while ensuring the **conceptual materials receive proper attribution**.

If you want, I can also generate the full text of both licenses as separate files (e.g., `LICENSES/`).
